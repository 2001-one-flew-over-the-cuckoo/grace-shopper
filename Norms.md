# Project Norms

Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions

* What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)? Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?
  **We vote and then escalate to fellow/instructor if we need a tiebreaker.**
  * What does this group do when a member is frustrated? **Figure out if something is going on! Maybe they’re stuck! If you're stuck, talk about it in standup. Dont wait to ask for help!**

* What does this group do when we merge our work together?
  * **We'll get togther and go over merges at the oend of the day and at the standup in the morning if we work at home/nighttime.**
* When does this group ask for help?
  **Slack each other first but if one of us is super busy, don't wait on them to call a fellow/teacher.**
* How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
  * Do members of a pair decide their own norms? **YES. Just be sensitive to how often the other person gets to code!**
* How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
  * Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present? **Do it during lunch! If we're looking at doing stuff individually afterhours, feel free to research and bring back pseudocode. Let everyone know at the OED merge.**
* What time does this group have daily stand up?
  * **10:30am** and another in the afternoon if needed after lunch (2:30ish) plus merge at EOD
  * Coffee in the morning or a walk around the block after lunch?
* **After hours slacks:** Dont expect a response after hours, but feel free to message whenever!
* We live far from each other, let’s do hangouts chats, zoom, etc. if we need to!
