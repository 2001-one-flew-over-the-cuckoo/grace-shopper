#Care Kit

## Self Care and Gift Kits

#### Roles

* Taskmaster
* Gitmaster
* Testmaster

### Daily process

* Morning stand up (11:00AM)
  * Started by yesterday's Taskmaster
  * Coffee?
  * New roles assigned (by yesterday's Taskmaster)
  * Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today's Taskmaster)
* Pair program on assigned tasks
  * Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
  * Bring up any blocking issues on slack! If we all feel stuck, escalate to fellow/instructor
* Post-luch re-group (2:30pm)
  * Check-in with blockers, status updates andplan for EOD merge
  * Possibly walk around the block
* EOD Merge (5:30-5:45ish)
  * Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other's code and merge into master.
  * Go over any potential individual work people want to do after hours, if they want to finish up today's work or any research/pseudo-code.

### Team expectations

* Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project. **Slack message anytime, but don't expect an answer if it's not business hours.**
* If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another's train of coding-thought

---

* We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
* None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
* Don't interrupt - raise your hand
* Share the mic
* Disagree often and discuss! Argue as infrequently as possible
* At least message the group when you change what you are working on

---

### Issues

* If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:

# Project Norms

* What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)? We vote and then escalate if we need a tiebreaker. Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?
  * What does this group do when a member is frustrated? **Figure out if something is going on! Maybe they're stuck! If you're stuck, talk about it in standup. Dont wait to ask for help!**
* What does this group do when we merge our work together?
  * **We'll get togther and go over merges at the oend of the day and at the standup in the morning if we work at home/nighttime.**
* When does this group ask for help?
  **Slack each other first but if one of us is super busy, don't wait on them to call a fellow/teacher.**
* How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
  * Do members of a pair decide their own norms? **YES. Just be sensitive to how often the other person gets to code!**
* How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
  * Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present? **Do it during lunch! If we're looking at doing stuff individually afterhours, feel free to research and bring back pseudocode. Let everyone know at the OED merge.**
* What time does this group have daily stand up?
  * **11:00am** and another in the afternoon if needed after lunch (2:30ish) plus merge at EOD
  * Coffee in the morning or a walk around the block after lunch?
* **After hours slacks:** Dont expect a response after hours, but feel free to message whenever!
* We live far from each other, let's do hangouts chats, zoom, etc. if we need to!
